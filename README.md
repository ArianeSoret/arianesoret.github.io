## <img src="selfie.png" style="float: left;" alt="drawing" width="200"/>  About Me 
I am a research scientist at the [University of Luxembourg](https://www.uni.lu/fstm-en/research-departments/department-of-physics-materials-science/), in the group of [Massimiliano Esposito](https://sites.google.com/site/massimilianoespositogennaro/home). My research interests include quantum thermodynamics, quantum optics, mesoscopic physics, statistical mechanics and many-body quantum systems. My latest projects focus on adapting the methods of stochastic thermodynamics to study energy fluctuations of photons interacting with quantum systems, in particular in far from equilibrium regimes and non linear regimes.
